### A static website for a fictive business called "Donot".

Built with HTML and CSS only.

This was an assignment for a 3 week graphics design course called "graphic interfaces".

#### First steps:

First off I made the products, logos and symbols using Adobe Illustrator.

#### Making of this site:

I first off started by making wireframes for all sites:

#### Then I made mockup versions:

#### Final step: 

And finally the whole site was built using the mockups, starting with mobile, I tried to follow them as much as possible but some minor changes (as in sizes and placements) had to be made due to fonts and pictures looking different when applied to code.

#### Responsive breakpoints:

640px - Mobile

1024px - Tablet

1440 - Desktop
